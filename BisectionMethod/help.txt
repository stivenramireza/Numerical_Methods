HELP Bisection Method!

This method seeks an approximation to the root of a function by entering data such as the 
starting point and the end point that define the interval, the tolerance that indicates the
number of correct decimals and significant figures that the delivered result will have. 
To do this, a tour is made with N iterations entered by the user where the midpoint of the 
interval is found, increasing its error with the idea that it is close to zero and that the
absolute or relative error requested by the user resolves the Equation correctly.
