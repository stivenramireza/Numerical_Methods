HELP Relaxed Gauss-Seidel Method!

In this method, we start with a vector of initial values to start iterating.
The new values of each vector are calculated in order and used immediately
for subsequent values. The components of each vector are found and stops when
it meets a certain tolerance. This presents a relaxed <1 or >1.
