HELP Simple Gaussian Elimination Factorization Method!

This method factored a matrix into two matrices L and U, which apply
progressive and regressive substitution respectively. After that applies
simple gaussian elimination by placing zeros under the pivot through the use of
fundamental operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication, but
does not include exchange of rows or columns.
