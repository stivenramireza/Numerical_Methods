HELP Fake Rule Method!

This method, like the bisection method, requires the user to enter the start and end points to define the interval,
in addition to the tolerance with the correct decimals and significant figures and the number of iterations in which
it is desired to find an approximation of the root of the function entered.

The difference of this method with the previous one is that the way of calculating the midpoint is different. This 
is done by subtracting the initial point with the division between the function evaluated at that point by the subtraction
of the initial point with the end point and the subtraction of the function evaluated at the initial point with that of the
end point (interval xi, xs).
