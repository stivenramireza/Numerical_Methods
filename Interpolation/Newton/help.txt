HELP Newton's Method with Divided Differences!

This method consists in that given n + 1 points (Xi, f (Xi)), we seek to obtain a polynomial P 
of degree N at most that passes through each one of them. The polynomial is of the form: 
Pn (x) = b0 + b1 (x-x0) + b2 (x-x0) (x-x1) + ... + bn (x-x0) ... (x-xn -1).

The diagonal of the generated chart are the values of bn that is the result of their divided 
differences.
