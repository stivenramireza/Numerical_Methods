HELP Lagrange Method!

This method starts from a set of n + 1 known points. It is described as follows: 
y = sum (Lk (x) * f (Xk)) from k = 0 until n.

Where for each i, the value of Li (x) is determined as the product:
produc (x-xi / xk-xi) from i = 0, i! = k until n.

In this way it is guaranteed that the polynomial found passes through all the given points.
